* static -> compile time -> what's stated in the expression
* dynamic -> runtime -> what's acutally passed to the variable

> The dynamic type of an expression that is neither a reference nor a pointer is always the same as that expressionâ€™s static type. For example, a variable of type Quote is always a Quote object; there is nothing we can do that will change the type of the object to which that variable corresponds.
